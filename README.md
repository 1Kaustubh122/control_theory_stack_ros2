# robotics-control-stack
Advanced robotics control: from optimal and nonlinear to robust and learning-based methods.
A complete robotics control theory stack ‚Äî from classical PID to nonlinear, robust, optimal, and learning-based control.

This repository implements the full spectrum of control algorithms used in modern robotics, including classical control (PID, LQR), optimal control (MPC), nonlinear control (backstepping, feedback linearization), robust control (H‚àû), and learning-integrated methods (CiMPCC, RL-based control).

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch with Python and NumPy/PyTorch wherever applicable, with clean modular code and visualizations.

‚öôÔ∏è Designed for robotics applications including autonomous vehicles (F1TENTH), drones, and manipulators.

üìö Includes theory explanations, usage demos, and integration-ready code for simulation environments like CARLA and Isaac Sim.
